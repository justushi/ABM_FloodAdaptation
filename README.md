# ABM_FloodAdaptation
The goal of the ABM is to model the adaptation behaviour of household agents and to understand the role of government subsidies in increasing the implementation of flood adaptation measures in the Harrison County. 

The model seeks to address the following research question: 
What is the effect of subsidies on flood adaptation under flooding conditions as measured by the total number of households that decide to take the adaptation measures?

The agents are households. Households interact with the environment and in this model households don't interact with other households, but they are connected in a social network. Two main theories have been used within the modelling decisions, namely the PMT and individual risk, the latter of which was included as the Reusable Building Block. One key performance indicator was tracked to answer the research question, namely the total number of households that decide to take adaptation measures. Thereafter, experimentation was used to test different policy variations: the base case had no subsidy, policy 1 would only consider individual risk in tiering of subsidy height, and policy 2 would consider both individual risk and the income group to tier the subsidy height.
